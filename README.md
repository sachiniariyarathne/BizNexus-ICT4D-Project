# BizNexus: Empowering Sri Lanka's SMEs

## Project Overview

Developed BizNexus, a digital platform aimed at strengthening Sri Lanka’s Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), as part of the ICT for Development (Community Informatics) module. This solution addresses key challenges faced by SMEs, such as limited funding, low market visibility, compliance barriers, and lack of expert support by connecting entrepreneurs with investors, consultants, and growth opportunities.

Small and Medium Enterprises form the backbone of Sri Lanka’s economy, accounting for:  
- 90% of all businesses  
- 52% of the nation’s GDP  
- 45% of employment  

Despite their significance, SMEs contribute less than 5% of export revenue, reflecting untapped potential and systemic challenges such as:  
- Limited access to funding and business development resources  
- Difficulty retaining skilled talent and accessing expertise  
- Compliance, certification, and regulatory barriers  
- Low market visibility and weak investor networks  
- A lack of reliable data and strategic support  

## Key Features

- Investor matchmaking to facilitate easier access to finance  
- Business consultancy and mentoring from industry experts  
- Innovation partnerships to scale ventures  
- A networking and knowledge-sharing community  
- Guidance on marketing strategies and distribution expansion  

## How It Works

Entrepreneurs and innovators connect with investors seeking funding and guidance, while investors engage with credible proposals through a data-driven platform that fosters transparent and efficient collaboration.

## Sustainability at the Core

BizNexus aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to ensure long-term, inclusive growth:  
- **SDG 8:** Promoting decent work and economic growth  
- **SDG 9:** Fostering industry, innovation, and infrastructure  
- **SDG 17:** Building partnerships for collaborative success
